# Vision

Tell your computer what to do, and it gets it done.

## Roadmap

## Contributing

We love contributions! Feel free to open issues for bugs or feature requests. To contribute to the docs, check out the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ How to make your agents robust?

We offer to run your tasks in our CI‚Äîautomatically, on every update!

- **Add your task:** Add a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
- **Automatic validation:** Every time we push updates, your task will be run by the agent and evaluated using your criteria.

## Local Setup

To learn more about the library, check out the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

`main` is the primary development branch with frequent changes. For production use, install a stable [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases) instead.
